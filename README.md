# Walmart-Sales-Performance-Forecasting-Dashboard 

This project is to analyze Walmart's sales performance across 45 stores over a
three-year period by identifying trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales. Specifically,
this project aims to identify the highest and lowest sales recorded in different quarters and
years, as well as determine which stores experienced the most significant quarter-over-
quarter and total sales growth. Additionally, it seeks to evaluate the impact of external
economic factors, including temperature, Consumer Price Index (CPI), fuel prices, and
unemployment, on sales performance. Understanding how holiday and non-holiday periods
affect overall sales, as well as store-specific sales, is another key objective. This project will
further analyze how holiday and non-holiday sales fluctuate across different months and
identify the specific day of the week that consistently generates the highest sales. Moreover,
it aims to determine the top performing stores based on total sales over the three-year period
and point out the year, month, and quarter in which Walmart achieved its highest sales.
Lastly, this project will track and analyze the trend of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over time
across all stores on a monthly and yearly basis. By achieving these objectives, this project aims
to provide valuable insights that can enhance business strategies, optimize resource
allocation, and improve overall sales performance.
